# BiscuitPortfolio
BiscuitPortfolio is portfolio software, designed for Minecraft and other gaming server staff applications. You can host a portfolio of previous staff experience on gaming servers, which can help speed up applications.
## History
I wanted to make a portfolio for my Minecraft staffing experience, after I resigned from BumbleCraft, but I noticed that all of the software I looked at was not free, which led me to creating BiscuitPortfolio `Early Alpha 1`.
